# HOODS - HOusing Open Data Survey

## Introduction

The project focuses on creating a web application that simplifies the process of choosing a neighborhood in Barcelona based on user preferences and data-driven insights. We implemented a system that not only collects data from various sources but also transparently combines it into a concise neighborhood rating. This rating assists users in making informed decisions when considering a move.

## Methodology

The application comprises a well-designed frontend with a streamlined set of features for user interaction. The backend efficiently retrieves, processes, and combines data from webpages and APIs, including Open Data Barcelona, Google Maps, and the official Ajuntament Barcelona website. Preprocessed data is periodically updated to ensure relevance. All services are deployed using a microservice architecture on AWS, with the backend fully serverless.

## Conclusion

While the application offers room for future extensions and improvements, it effectively aids users in selecting the most suitable Barcelona neighborhood for their needs. This eliminates the manual and time-consuming task of sifting through unprocessed internet data, making the decision-making process more efficient and data-informed.
